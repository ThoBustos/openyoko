# Cadences: The Rhythm of Intentional Living

Personal Agent OS works through regular reflection cadences. These are not obligations—they're investments in clarity that pay compounding returns.

---

## Overview

| Cadence | Time | Frequency | Purpose |
|---------|------|-----------|---------|
| Daily | 5-10 min | Every day | Stay aligned |
| Weekly | 30-45 min | Sunday/Monday | Plan and reflect |
| Monthly | 60-90 min | First of month | Deep calibration |
| Quarterly | 2-3 hours | Every 3 months | Strategic review |
| Yearly | Half day | January | Vision refresh |

---

## Daily Cadence (5-10 minutes)

The daily check-in keeps you aligned without becoming a burden.

### Morning (2-3 minutes)

Open your weekly doc (`02_JOURNAL/Weekly/{{year}}-W{{week}}.md`) and:

1. **Check your Top 3** - What must happen today?
2. **Set intention** - How do you want to show up?
3. **Glance at your keystone** - Is today moving you toward it?

### Evening (3-5 minutes)

Before winding down:

1. **Log your energy** - Rate 1-10, note what affected it
2. **Capture notes** - What happened? What did you learn?
3. **Gratitude** - One thing you're grateful for (tag with #gratitude)
4. **Check tomorrow** - Quick glance at what's ahead

### The Daily Compass

Five questions to run through your day against:

- [ ] **Body** - Did I move?
- [ ] **Create** - Did I make something?
- [ ] **Truth** - Did I tell the truth?
- [ ] **Connect** - Did I connect with someone?
- [ ] **Awe** - Did I feel gratitude or wonder?

You don't need to hit all five daily—but if you consistently miss one, that's signal.

## Weekly Cadence (30-45 minutes)

Best done Sunday evening or Monday morning. This is your most important ritual.

### Setup (5 min)

1. Create new week doc from template (`templates/weekly.md`)
2. Copy to `02_JOURNAL/Weekly/{{year}}-W{{week}}.md`
3. Fill in dates

### Review Last Week (10 min)

Look at your previous weekly doc:

1. **What went well?** - Celebrate wins, note what worked
2. **What didn't?** - No judgment, just observation
3. **What should change?** - One adjustment for next week
4. **Pillar scores** - Rate each pillar 1-10

### Plan This Week (15-20 min)

1. **Set your Keystone Focus**
   > "If only one thing worked this week, what matters most?"

   This is your north star. Everything else is secondary.

2. **Pillar Intentions**
   Set intentions for 3-5 pillars (not all 10). Focus on what needs attention.

3. **One Brave Act**
   > "What uncomfortable thing will I do?"

   Growth lives at the edge of comfort.

4. **One Joy Anchor**
   > "What will I do purely for aliveness?"

   Schedule this. It won't happen otherwise.

5. **One System Upgrade**
   > "What will make future weeks easier?"

   Small improvements compound.

### Update State (5 min)

1. Update `00_SYSTEM/GLOBAL_STATE.md` with current focus
2. Update any project `_STATE.md` files that changed
3. Commit changes to git

## Monthly Cadence (60-90 minutes)

Best done the first weekend of each month. This is deep calibration.

### Part 1: The 8 Questions (45 min)

Work through these in your monthly doc (`02_JOURNAL/Monthly/{{year}}-{{month}}.md`):

#### 1. Identity Calibration
- Who did I become this month?
- What traits strengthened?
- What traits weakened?
- Am I closer to or further from who I want to be?

#### 2. Energy Audit
- What gave me energy?
- What drained energy?
- Are there patterns?

#### 3. Truth Inventory
- What am I avoiding?
- What conversation am I postponing?
- What truth am I not telling myself?

#### 4. Relationship Scan
- Who felt closer?
- Who drifted?
- Who do I need to appreciate?
- Who do I need to have a hard conversation with?

#### 5. Creation Review
- What did I create this month?
- Was it important or just urgent?
- What's the ratio?

#### 6. Leverage Check
- Did I build systems or just effort?
- Did I delegate or automate anything?
- What should I stop doing myself?

#### 7. Fear & Edge Detection
- Where did I avoid growth?
- What would I do if I weren't afraid?
- Where is my growth edge right now?

#### 8. Wonder Scan
- What gave me awe this month?
- When did I feel most alive?
- What made me curious?

### Part 2: Pillar Scores (15 min)

Rate each pillar 1-10 based on the month:

| Creation & Craft | /10 | |
| Wealth & Leverage | /10 | |
| Impact & Service | /10 | |
| Media & Personal Brand | /10 | |
| Exploration & Adventure | /10 | |

Look for:
- Any pillar below 5 (needs attention)
- Any pillar below 3 (crisis mode)
- Patterns over time (trending down?)

### Part 3: Next Month Focus (15 min)

Based on your review:

1. **Which 2-3 pillars need focus?**
2. **What's one thing to start?**
3. **What's one thing to stop?**
4. **What's one thing to continue?**

Update `00_SYSTEM/GLOBAL_STATE.md` with your monthly insights.

## Quarterly Cadence (2-3 hours)

   - Who have you neglected?

## Tips for Success

### Start Small

- Week 1: Just do daily check-ins
- Week 2: Add weekly planning
- Month 2: Add monthly reflection
- Then add quarterly and yearly

### Don't Force It

- Skip a day? Don't guilt yourself
- Miss a week? Pick up next week
- The system is here to serve you, not the other way around

### Use Claude

- Ask Claude to help with weekly reviews
- Have Claude prompt you through monthly questions
- Let Claude help you see patterns

### Track Progress

- Git history shows your evolution
- Monthly pillar scores reveal trends
- Yearly archives show transformation

### Adjust the Cadences

- Daily too much? Do it every other day
- Weekly too heavy? Simplify to 15 minutes
- Monthly too infrequent? Try bi-weekly deep dives

The cadences are defaults. Make them yours.
